High-end clothing made from pride silk is both fashionable and protective, leading many nobles and wealthy merchants to seek full outfits and formal gowns made with it.

The GM decides the type of each bead on the necklace or determines it randomly. A necklace can have more than one bead of the same type. To use one, you must be wearing the necklace. Each bead contains a spell that you can cast from it as a bonus action (using your spell save DC if a save is necessary). Once a magic bead's spell is cast, that bead can't be used again until the next dawn.}</div>\n<p> </p>","unidentified":"Wondrous item"},"source":"Basic Rules, Player's Handbook pg 182","quantity":1,"weight":0,"price":0,"attunement":1,"equipped":false,"rarity":"rare","identified":true,"activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":null,"attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"armor":{"value":10,"type":"trinket","dex":null},"hp":{"value":0,"max":0,"dt":null,"conditions":""},"baseItem":"","speed":{"value":null,"conditions":""},"strength":0,"stealth":false,"proficient":true,"properties":{"mgc":true}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Ngko0r49XU4taTEN":3},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"dndbeyond":{"type":"Wondrous item","avatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/18/903/636381755691898979.jpeg","largeAvatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/7/319/636284755345320839.jpeg","filterType":"Wondrous item","tags":["Healing","Summoning","Damage","Buff","Movement","Jewelry"],"sources":[{"sourceId":1,"pageNumber":null,"sourceType":2},{"sourceId":2,"pageNumber":182,"sourceType":1}],"pictureUrl":"ddb-images/other/item-large-Necklace-of-Prayer-Beads.jpeg"},"id":0,"entityTypeId":0,"definitionEntityTypeId":112130694,"definitionId":4684,"originalName":"Necklace of Prayer Beads","version":"2.7.6"},"magicitems":{"enabled":true,"charges":0,"chargeType":"c1","rechargeable":false,"recharge":0,"rechargeType":"t2","rechargeUnit":"","destroy":false,"destroyCheck":"d1","spells":{},"feats":{},"tables":{},"equipped":true,"attuned":false,"destroyFlavorText":"reaches 0 charges: it crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.","sorting":"l"}},"_id":"ssBlWCCTKeDLth2B"}
